# Russian Conversion
A program that transforms english typing into russian at runtime.


## Requirements
Uses the library of pynput, to convert the english typing into russian, and to track what is being typed. 


## Installation
To install run the following command:  <br>
``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ``` 


## Usage
To use run the script with the following <br>
``` ./russian_conversion_script ```. <br>
or run the following your terminal window <br>
``` python3 russian_conversion_process ```


## Things to Add (WIP Project)
- Add machine learning so words would autocorrect (complicated)
- Add better conversion so that russian characters are easier to acces
    - specifically characters that map to "sh" or "sch" that are more than one character
- Add tab autocomplete so it knows what character to go to
