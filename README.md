# Russian Conversion
A program that transforms english typing into russian at runtime.

## Installation
To install run the following command:
``` 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

## Usage
Clone the repo through ssh or html and cd into the directory with 
``` 
git clone git@github.com:mgoldgirsh/russian-conversion.git
cd russian-coversion
```

Then to use, run the script with the following
``` 
chmod +x russian_conversion_script
./russian_conversion_script 
```   
or run the following your terminal window
``` 
python3 russian_conversion_process 
```

## Things to Add (WIP Project)
- Add machine learning so words would autocorrect (complicated)
- Add better conversion so that russian characters are easier to acces
    - specifically characters that map to "sh" or "sch" that are more than one character
- Add tab autocomplete so it knows what character to go to
