# Russian Conversion
A program that transforms english typing into russian at runtime.

## Requirements
Uses the library of pynput, to convert the english typing into russian, and to track what is being typed. 

## Installation
To install run the following command:  <br>
``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ``` 

## Usage
Clone the repo through ssh or html, with 
``` 
git clone git@github.com:mgoldgirsh/russian-conversion.git
```

To use run the script with the following
``` 
./russian_conversion_script 
```   
or run the following your terminal window
``` 
python3 russian_conversion_process 
```

## Things to Add (WIP Project)
- Add machine learning so words would autocorrect (complicated)
- Add better conversion so that russian characters are easier to acces
    - specifically characters that map to "sh" or "sch" that are more than one character
- Add tab autocomplete so it knows what character to go to
